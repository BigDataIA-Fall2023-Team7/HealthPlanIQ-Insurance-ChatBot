## Overview: 
The project involves developing a digital assistant, known as InsureBot, to aid individuals in choosing their Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) for the upcoming year. The focus is on facilitating informed decision-making by incorporating RAG search and analytics.

## Features: 

The digital assistant addresses users' natural language queries concerning Qualified Health Plans (QHPs).
Chatbot recommends multiple plans according to user-specified conditions and criteria, providing insights to assist users in identifying the most suitable insurance option.
Users can inquire about the drugs covered in a particular plan, as the bot possesses information on the drug coverage associated with each insurance plan.
